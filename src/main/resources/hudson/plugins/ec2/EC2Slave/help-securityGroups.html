<div>
    Specify the security group names (do not specify the security group IDs) that will be applied to this instance.
    If there are multiple security groups, separate them by a semi-colon (ex: Group One; Group2; Group 3;). If there is only one group, place a semi-colon at the end of the line (ex: Group 1;). If the instance uses a VPC (you have specified
    a subnet ID for the VPC), then all security groups need to be part of the VPC.
