Critical.Title=Critically Unsafe Linux EC2 templates found
Critical.AffectedTemplates=There are some EC2 templates using the <i>OFF</i> host key strategy, for example: <i>{0}</i>.
Critical.Explanation=The instances created using those templates are not safe from a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><acronym title="man-in-the-middle">MitM</acronym> attack</a>. \
                    Please consider updating these templates to use a more secure template. Visit  \
                    <a href="{0}/configure">Jenkins configure page</a> and select a more secure strategy on the \
                    <i>Host Key Verification Strategy</i> field of the affected templates (click <i>Advanced...</i> button to see the field).



Unsafe.Title=Unsafe Linux EC2 templates found
Unsafe.AffectedTemplates=There are some EC2 templates using the <i>accept-new</i> or <i>check-new-soft</i> host key strategies, for example: <i>{0}</i>.
Unsafe.Explanation=These strategies check the host key to ensure your connection is safe from a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><acronym title="man-in-the-middle">MitM</acronym> attack</a>. \
                    However, if such an attack was already perpetrated, the verification is useless. To be absolutely safe, consider using the <i>check-new-hard</i> \
                    strategy (your instance should print out the key on the console to be checked). Visit \
                    <a href="{0}/configure">Jenkins configure page</a> and select a more secure strategy on the \
                    <i>Host Key Verification Strategy</i> field of the affected templates (click <i>Advanced...</i> button to see the field).
Unsafe.DismissTheseMessages=If you are sure your system is safe from a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><acronym title="man-in-the-middle">MitM</acronym> attack</a> \
                    and you don't worry about trusting instance identities the first time you connect to them without checking the key provided, you can <i>dismiss these messages</i> in the \
                    future. But be aware that if a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><acronym title="man-in-the-middle">MitM</acronym> attack</a> is successfully \
                    perpetrated, your communication with these instances will be on risk.

DismissAll.Message=If you don't want to see any message about the security concerning the host key verification on EC2 instances, you can <i>dismiss all messages</i>.
