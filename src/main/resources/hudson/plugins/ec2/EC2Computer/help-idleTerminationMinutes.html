<div>
    Determines how long agents can remain idle before being stopped or terminated (see the Stop/Disconnect on Idle Timeout setting).
    <p>
    Times are expressed in minutes.
    A value of 0 (or an empty string) indicates that idle agents should never be stopped/terminated.
    A negative value indicates that the instance should idle up to the billing hour, minus the idle minute time. For example, a value of
    -2 means that an instance will be retained if checked less than 58 minutes into the billing hour and found active, but stopped or
    terminated if found idle. This strategy keeps agents alive and available for additional work during already paid for period.
