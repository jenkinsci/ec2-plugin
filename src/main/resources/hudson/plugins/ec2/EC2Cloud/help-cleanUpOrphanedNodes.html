Enabling this option allows the plugin to automatically clean up orphaned nodes that are no longer associated with any Jenkins controller. It functions like a heartbeat mechanism, regularly updating the expiration time of connected instances. If an instance remains disconnected for a prolonged period, it is considered "orphaned" and will be terminated.
By default, the plugin checks for orphaned nodes every hour. If a node has been disconnected for 3 hours or more, it qualifies for termination.
