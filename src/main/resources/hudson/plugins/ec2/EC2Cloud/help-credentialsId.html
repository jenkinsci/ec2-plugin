<div>
    <p>Jenkins uses this access key ID and secret access key to interface with Amazon EC2.
        If you have already signed up on EC2, you can obtain this from
        <a href="http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key">here</a>.
        Otherwise, you need to sign up to Amazon Web Services to get one.</p>
    <p>
        If no access key is set, implicit authentication mechanisms are used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Environment Variables -
            <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>
            (RECOMMENDED since they are recognized by all the AWS SDKs and CLI except for .NET),
            or <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_KEY</code> (only recognized by Java SDK)
        </li>
        <li>Java System Properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey</li>
        <li>Credential profiles file at the default location (~/.aws/credentials) shared by all AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI</li>
        <li>Instance profile credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service (IAM role defined at the ec2 instance level)</li>
    </ul>
