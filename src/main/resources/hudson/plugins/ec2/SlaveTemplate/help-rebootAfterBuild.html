    Turning this option on will cause a slave to be rebooted after each build. This setting,
    obviously, only makes sense if at any time there can be only one job running on a slave and a slave
    is set up in such a way that rebooting it resets the slave to some baseline state. This is useful when 
    you have slaves that upon reboot reset to some baseline state, i.e. have ephemeral roots or directories
    (e.g. unionfs-fuse with RW tmpfs mounted over a read-only base).
    <br/>
    Since rebooting a slave costs very little time and is otherwise free, this method is financially preferable
    to terminating an instance and starting a new one, causing an additional charge. Also, a simple reboot may take less time
    than stop and start.
