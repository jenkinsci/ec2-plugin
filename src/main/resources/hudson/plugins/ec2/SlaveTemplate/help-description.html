<div>
Optional human-readable description of this agent. This information is displayed on the project 
configuration screen.
<br>
When you have agents that are different from others, 
it's often helpful to use this field to explain what is different. 
For example, entering "Windows agent" in this field would allow project owners to 
choose to always build on a Windows machine (for example, if they need some Windows-specific build tool.)
<br>
For EC2 agents, this is also used to allow the same AMI to be used multiple times and separately manage
the number of instances associated with each agent. The description forms part of the key (with the AMI id)
to determine the number of active instances.
