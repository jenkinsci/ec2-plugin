    Connect to the Jenkins Slave Agent through an external SSH client process.
    <p/>
    <strong>NOTE</strong>: The Jenkins Master must have an installed SSH Client.
    <p/>
    By default, the plugin connects to the slave agent using an in-process Java SSH client.
    By checking this configuration option, you are telling the plugin to launch an external
    local SSH client process and to use that instead to connect to the Jenkins Slave Agent
    running on the EC2 instance. This option has proven to produce a more stable connection
    in some environments.
