    Connect to the Jenkins Agent through an external SSH client process.
    <p/>
    <strong>NOTE</strong>: The Jenkins Controller must have an installed SSH Client.
    <p/>
    By default, the plugin connects to the Jenkins agent using an in-process Java SSH client.
    By checking this configuration option, you are telling the plugin to launch an external
    local SSH client process and to use that instead to connect to the Jenkins Agent
    running on the EC2 instance. This option has proven to produce a more stable connection
    in some environments.
