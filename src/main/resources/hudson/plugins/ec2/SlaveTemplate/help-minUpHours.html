<div>
	<p> Retains ephemeral agents for specified hours before applying "idle termination minutes" rules.
    <p>Overrides the default termination time by adding the specified number of hours before the evaluation is calculated</p>
    <p>Time is expressed in hours - default being 0 which causes the system to behave as if this wasn't set</p>
    <p>e.g. Setting it 7 will cause an instance to say up a minimum of 7 hours before it will be considered for shutdown</p>
