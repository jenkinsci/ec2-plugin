    Map all ephemeral devices that are allowed for given instance type. The
    block devices will appear as <tt>/dev/xvd[bcde]</tt> provided none of these
    are mapped already. Given that some device is mapped to <tt>/dev/xvdc</tt>
    in AMI configuration, the devices will appear as <tt>/dev/xvd[bdef]</tt>.
