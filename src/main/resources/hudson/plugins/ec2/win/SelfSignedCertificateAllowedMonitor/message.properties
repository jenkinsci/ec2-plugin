Title=Unsafe Windows EC2 templates found
AffectedTemplates=There are some Windows EC2 templates allowing self-signed certificates, for example: <i>{0}</i>.
Explanation=The instances created using those templates are not safe from a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"><acronym title="man-in-the-middle">MitM</acronym> attack</a>. \
                    Please consider updating these templates to avoid trusting self-signed certificates and ensure the \
                    certificate used by the instance is issued by a trusted Certification Authority. Visit  \
                    <a href="{0}/configure">Jenkins configure page</a> and uncheck the <i>Allow Self Signed Certificate</i> \
                     field of the affected templates. In addition make sure any non-terminable node is updated as well. \
                    There are many ways to obtain a certificate, such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/">Let''s Encrypt</a>, \
                    which allows you to get a free certificate, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a>, which is \
                    an AWS solution.
