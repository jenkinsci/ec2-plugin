Indicate here the time in seconds to wait for the machine to be ready once the plugin detects SSH is available.
Unfortunately, on Windows during the boot, the SSH service might be started, and then several minutes after will be
restarted. If this restart happens during the slave provisioning, Windows will prevent subsequent SSH connections and
the slave will not be correctly provisioned.
