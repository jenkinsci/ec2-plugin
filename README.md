# Introduction

Allow Jenkins to start agents on
[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or
[Eucalyptus](https://www.eucalyptus.com/) on demand, and
kill them as they get unused.  

With this plugin, if Jenkins notices that your build cluster is
overloaded, it'll start instances using the EC2 API and automatically
connect them as Jenkins agents. When the load goes down, excess EC2
instances will be terminated. This set up allows you to maintain a small
in-house cluster, then spill the spiky build/test loads into EC2 or
another EC2 compatible cloud.

# Usage

First, go to [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and sign
up for the service. Once you've installed the plugin, you navigate to
the main "Manage Jenkins" \> "Configure System" page, and scroll down
near the bottom to the "Cloud" section. There, you click the "Add a new
cloud" button, and select the "Amazon EC2" option. This will display the
UI for configuring the EC2 plugin.  Then enter the Access Key and Secret
Access Key which act like a username/password (see IAM section). Because
of the way EC2 works, you also need to have an RSA private key that the
cloud has the other half for, to permit sshing into the instances that
are started. If you have already been using EC2 and have your own key,
you can paste it here. Otherwise, you can have Jenkins generate one. If
you let Jenkins generate one, you should save this private key in your
file system as well, as you'll need this to interactively logon to EC2
instances.

Once you have put in your Access Key and Secret Access Key, select a
region for the cloud (not shown in screenshot). You may define only one
cloud for each region, and the regions offered in the UI will show only
the regions that you don't already have clouds defined for them.

Use "Test Connection" button to verify that Jenkins can successfully
talk to EC2. If you are using UEC you need to click on Advanced and fill
out the endpoint details for your cluster.

![](docs/images/cloud.png)

Next, configure AMIs that you want to launch. For this, you need to find
the AMI IDs for the OS of your choice.
[Packer](https://packer.io/) is a good tool for doing
that. Jenkins can work with any Unix AMIs. If using an Ubuntu EC2 or UEC
AMI you need to fill out the `rootCommandPrefix` and
`remoteAdmin` fields under `advanced`. Windows is currently somewhat
supported.

Configuring labels allow Jenkins to pick the right AMI to start. For
example, if all your existing agents labeled "solaris" are fully busy
and you have more builds that are tied to the "solaris" label, Jenkins
will start the AMIs that have the "solaris" label.

Init script is the shell script to be run on the newly launched EC2
instance, before Jenkins starts launching a agent agent. If the AMI
doesn't have Java pre-installed, you can do this in the init script.
This is also a good place to install additional packages that you need
for your builds and tests.  The init script is located at
**/tmp/init.sh** and is owned and run by the user account specified in
the "Remote User" field (so use of "sudo" may be required for non-root
accounts).

![](docs/images/ami.png)

Configure several AMIs if you need different OS images.

With this setting, your Jenkins will automatically start instances when
the load goes up, and the instances will be terminated (or stopped - see
below) automatically if it's idle for more than 30 mins.

By default, instances are terminated when the idle timeout period
expires. You can change this by specifying the Stop/Disconnect on Idle
Timeout flat in the Advanced properties of the AMI configuration. If
this is specified, the instance is stopped when the timeout expires. If
the instance is required again, then the plugin will look for a stopped
instance that exactly corresponds to the AMI specification and resume it
if found. Otherwise a new instance is started. Having the instances be
stopped instead of terminated is useful when you are using EBS volumes
and want to keep them mounted for the life of the instance and reuse the
instance for long periods of time. This can greatly reduce the startup
time of the instance since it does not have to build the volume from the
snapshot.

## Spot Instances

Spot instances are similar to EC2 instances, except for a few key
differences. They are generally more affordable, but they have the
possibility of being terminated if someone has bid more on them than you
have and can take longer to provision.  To mitigate some of these
issues, your Jenkins and Agent AMIs will need a bit of configuration to
convert the Spot agents to register with Jenkins when they spawn up. Due
to these changes, it may appear that a Spot agent will have failed (with
a red X), but the message associated with the error will inform you if
the Spot instance just has not called back yet or not. For more
information on Spot instances, read the information
here: <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/> .

### Enable Spot Request

To enable use of Spot as opposed to EC2 for an instance, the "Use Spot
Instance" check box must be checked.  Also, a bid price must be
specified.  If you want to determine what the current price of the
instance is without going to the AWS website, pick your region and
instance type (as you already should) and click "Check Current Spot
Price".

To choose between a Persistent or One Time bid (to keep the bid alive
until cancelled or to stop the bid after it has been fulfilled once),
choose from the drop down menu.

### Configure Jenkins for Spot Support

For Jenkins, the major configuration change will be if you have a
restrictive firewall, since these instances need to connect back to
Jenkins.  The first configuration change to Jenkins is to change your
Jenkins URL option in the Configure Jenkins page to be the external URL
to the server.  One port that needs to be open is the one that you use
to access Jenkins, the other is the JNLP port, which is generally
randomly assigned.  To set the JNLP port to something predictable,
follow the Connection Mechanism section on this page. [Jenkins
CLI](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI)

### Configure AMI for Spot Support

In order for your EC2 instance to know that it is to be a Jenkins agent,
it must be preconfigured with start up commands so that it can register
itself with Jenkins.  The Jenkins information is passed to the Spot
agents via EC2 user-data.  This information includes the name that
Jenkins has given the agent, and the configured URL for the Jenkins
master node.  

Sample scripts for assisting in configuring an Ubuntu based AMI to work
with the Jenkins ec2-plugin and Spot agents are included with the
installation of the plugin.   
Config Script:

```sh
(jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-ami-setup.sh
```

Startup Script:

```sh
(jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-init.py
```

The config script is run by the user from the EC2 instance with root
access.  It installs Java onto the instance and fetches the startup
script and sets it to run when the machine starts up.  It can be
retrieved from the above url using a command like wget, or copied over
using a tool like `scp`.

```sh
wget (jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-ami-setup.sh
```

Once the scripts have been downloaded, the script can be run. Running
this script will also run the `ubuntu-init.py` script, so there is no
need to run it on its own.

```sh
sudo sh ubuntu-ami-setup.sh jenkins_server{:port}
```

Note: ‘http://” will be prepended to the jenkins\_server parameter

The config script then fetches the startup script and sets up the AMI to
register itself with a Jenkins master node when it gets started.

After setting up the image, you can save the image using Amazon’s EC2
web console. To do this, right click on your instance from the console
and select “Create Image (EBS AMI)”.

In order to set up additional images using other operating systems, you
can configure your own startup script based on the startup script above.
 This script should perform the following actions when the machine is
started up:

```sh
# Verify that Java is installed

# Install Java if it is not installed

# Read user data for the EC2 instance. It is available from [http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data]

# Values are passed in with the format of JENKINS_URL=[Jenkins_Url]&SLAVE_NAME=[Agent_Name]&USER_DATA=[other_user_data]

# Parse the values to retrieve the Jenkins_Url and Agent_Name
# Fetch the agent.jar from the Jenkins master using wget (or something similar)

wget [Jenkins_Url]jnlpJars/agent.jar -O agent.jar
# Register the agent to the Jenkins master node

java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl [Jenkins_Url]computer/ [Agent_Name] slave-agent.jnlp
```

## IAM setup

It's possible to create a separate account for jenkins using the Amazon
IAM feature. Go to the IAM tab in AWS console and create a user. Then go
to user's ***Permissions*** tab and use this policy (change username if
your user is not called ***jenkins***):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1312295543082",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeSpotInstanceRequests",
                "ec2:CancelSpotInstanceRequests",
                "ec2:GetConsoleOutput",
                "ec2:RequestSpotInstances",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteTags",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "ec2:GetPasswordData"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you want to launch agents with IAM Instance Profile, "iam:PassRole"
permission is required.

If you want to launch Windows agents and use the generated Administrator
password, the "ec2:GetPasswordData" permission is also required.

# Known Issues

## Authentication Timeout

If you have issues with authentication timing out as a node is starting
(see the stack traces in
[JENKINS-30284](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-30284)) you
can use these System Properties to adjust the number of tries and
timeout values:

    jenkins.ec2.bootstrapAuthSleepMs (default 30000)
    jenkins.ec2.bootstrapAuthTries (default 30)

## Amazon Linux build/connectivity issues

If you are using a Amazon Linux AMI and encounter exceptions like
***java.io.FileNotFoundException:
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.201.b09-0.amzn2.x86\_64/jre/lib/currency.data
(No such file or directory)*** or ***Remote call on EC2
\[...\] failed*** then chances are that the Amazon Linux is doing some
security upgrades in the background and causes the slave to be in an
invalid state.

From the
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#security-updates)
of the Amazon Linux it's stated:

> Amazon Linux is configured to download and install security updates at
> launch time.\[...\] The default setting for repo\_upgrade is security.
> That is, if you don't specify a different value in your user data, by
> default, Amazon Linux performs the security upgrades at launch for any
> packages installed at that time

This issue can be solved in different ways:

1.  Update your AMI and execute the security fixes =\> this will mean
    however that the issue could eventually come back
2.  Update your AMI and disable auto update of security fixes (see
    amazon
    [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#security-updates))
3.  Force security upgrade through the "init-script" in the Cloud
    configuration
